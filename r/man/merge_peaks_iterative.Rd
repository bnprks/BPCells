\title{Merge peaks}
\usage{
merge_peaks_iterative(peaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{Peaks given as GRanges, data.frame, or list. See \code{help("genomic-ranges-like")} for details on format and coordinate systems. Required attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{chr}, \code{start}, \code{end}: genomic position
}

Must be ordered by priority and have columns chr, start, end.}
}
\value{
\code{tibble::tibble()} with a nonoverlapping subset of the rows in peaks. All metadata
columns are preserved
}
\description{
Merge peaks according to ArchR's iterative merging algorithm. More
details on the \href{https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/the-iterative-overlap-peak-merging-procedure.html}{ArchR website}
}
\details{
Properties of merged peaks:
\itemize{
\item No peaks in the merged set overlap
\item Peaks are prioritized according to their order in the original input
\item The output peaks are a subset of the input peaks, with no peak boundaries
changed
}
}
\examples{
## Create example peaks
peaks <- tibble::tibble(
 chr = "chr1",
 start = as.integer(1:10),
 end = start + 2L
)
peaks

## Merge peaks
