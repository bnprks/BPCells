\title{Wrap \code{ragg::agg_png()} with optional one-shot height scaling}
\usage{
ragg_wrap(
  filename = "Rplot\%03d.png",
  width = 480,
  height = 480,
  units = "px",
  pointsize = 12,
  background = "white",
  res = 72,
  scaling = 1,
  snap_rect = TRUE,
  bitsize = 8,
  bg
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The name of the file. Follows the same semantics as the file naming in \code{grDevices::png()},
meaning that you can provide a sprintf() compliant string format to name multiple plots (such as the default value)}

\item{width, height}{The dimensions of the device}

\item{units}{The unit width and height is measured in,
in either pixels \code{('px')}, inches \code{('in')}, millimeters \code{('mm')}, or centimeter \code{('cm')}.}

\item{pointsize}{The default pointsize of the device in pt.
This will in general not have any effect on grid graphics (including ggplot2) as text size is always set explicitly there.}

\item{background}{The background color of the device}

\item{res}{The resolution of the device.
This setting will govern how device dimensions given in inches, centimeters, or millimeters will be converted to pixels.
Further, it will be used to scale text sizes and linewidths}

\item{scaling}{A scaling factor to apply to the rendered line width and text size. Useful for getting the right dimensions
at the resolution that you need. If e.g. you need to render a plot at 4000x3000 pixels for it to fit into a layout,
but you find that the result appears to small, you can increase the \code{scaling} argument to make everything appear bigger at the same resolution.}

\item{snap_rect}{Should axis-aligned rectangles drawn with only fill snap to the pixel grid.
This will prevent anti-aliasing artifacts when two rectangles are touching at their border.}

\item{bitsize}{Should the dvice record colour as 8 or 16bit}

\item{bg}{Same as \code{background} for compatibility with old graphic device APIs`}
}
\value{
A graphics device as returned by \code{ragg::agg_png()}.
}
\description{
Use \code{scale_next_plot_height()} to temporarily adjust the height of the \emph{next}
call to \code{ragg_wrap()}. This is handy when a downstream plot (e.g., produced
by \code{trackplot_combine()}) renders too tall/short in a pipeline and you want a
quick scaling tweak without touching the plot code itself. The scaling factor
is applied once and then cleared.
