\usage{
ragg_wrap(
  filename = "Rplot\%03d.png",
  width = 480,
  height = 480,
  units = "px",
  pointsize = 12,
  background = "white",

}
\value{
A graphics device as returned by \code{ragg::agg_png()}.
}
\description{
Use \code{scale_next_plot_height()} to temporarily adjust the height of the \emph{next}
call to \code{ragg_wrap()}. This is handy when a downstream plot (e.g., produced
by \code{trackplot_combine()}) renders too tall/short in a pipeline and you want a
quick scaling tweak without touching the plot code itself. The scaling factor
is applied once and then cleared.
