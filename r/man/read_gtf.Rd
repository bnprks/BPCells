\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to file (or desired save location if backup_url is used)}

\item{attributes}{Vector of GTF attribute names to parse out as columns}

\item{tags}{Vector of tags to parse out as boolean presence/absence}

\item{features}{List of features types to keep from the GTF (e.g. gene, transcript, exon, intron)}

\item{keep_attribute_column}{Boolean for whether to preserve the raw attribute text column}

\item{backup_url}{If path does not exist, provides a URL to download the gtf from}

\item{timeout}{Maximum time in seconds to wait for download from backup_url}

\item{dir}{Output directory to cache the downloaded gtf file}

\item{release}{release version (prefix with M for mouse versions). For
most recent version, use "latest" or "latest_mouse"}

\item{annotation_set}{Either "basic" or "comprehensive" annotation sets (see details section).}

\item{gene_type}{Regular expression with which gene types to keep.
Defaults to protein_coding, lncRNA, and IG/TR genes}

\item{transcript_choice}{Method for selecting representative transcripts. Choices are:
\itemize{
\item MANE_Select: human-only, most conservative
\item Ensembl_Canonical: human+mouse, superset of MANE_Select for human
\item all: Preserve all transcript models (not recommended for plotting)
}}
}
\value{
Data frame with coordinates using the 0-based convention. Columns are:
\itemize{
\item chr
\item source
\item feature
\item start
\item end
\item score
\item strand
\item frame
\item attributes (optional; named according to listed attributes)
\item tags (named according to listed tags)
}
}
\description{
Read gene annotations from gtf format into a data frame. The source can be
a URL, a gtf file on disk, or a gencode release version.
}
\details{
\strong{read_gtf}

Read gtf from a file or URL

\strong{read_gencode_genes}

Read gene annotations directly from GENCODE. The file name will vary depending
on the release and annotation set requested, but will be of the format
\code{gencode.v42.annotation.gtf.gz}. GENCODE currently recommends the basic set:
\url{https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/}. In release 42, both the comprehensive and
basic sets had identical gene-level annotations, but the comprehensive set had
additional transcript variants annotated.

\strong{read_gencode_transcripts}

Read transcript models from GENCODE, for use with trackplot_gene()
