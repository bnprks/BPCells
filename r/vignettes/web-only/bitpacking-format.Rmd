This provides an overview of the BPCells compressed and uncompressed matrix
formats. While BPCells is pre-1.0 these formats may be updated, though BPCells 
aims to maintain backwards read-compatibility across updates.

Format version changes:

- v2 (March 2023): Add support for $>2^32$ non-zero entries or fragments in a single file.
    - `idxptr`: uint32 -> uint64
    - `chr_ptr`: uint32 -> uint64
    - Add `*_idx_offsets` fields to bitpacked data.
- v1 (August 2022): Initial stability of v1 file formats

## Matrix Logical Storage Layout

For data storage, we use a storage abstraction of named data arrays, stored as
e.g. a single group hdf5 or a directory of files. The matrix format is a
compressed sparse column/row (CSC/CSR) format with the following data arrays:

| Name            | Type                   | Length      |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `val`           | uint32/float32/float64 | # non-zeros |
| `index`         | uint32                 | # non-zeros |
| `idxptr`        | uint64                 | # cols + 1  |
| `shape`         | uint32                 | 2           |
| `row_names`     | string                 | 0 or #rows  |
| `col_names`     | string                 | 0 or #cols  |
| `storage_order` | string                 | 1           |

The interpretation of each array is as follows:

- `val` - Values of non-zero entries in increasing order of (column, row) position.
- `index` - `index[i]` provides the 0-based row index for the value found in
  `val[i]` (or column index for row-major storage order)
- `idxptr` - The indexes in `idx` and `val` for the entries in column `j` can be
  found from `idxptr[j]` to `idxptr[j+1] - 1` , inclusive. (or row `j` for
  row-major storage order)
- `shape` - number of rows in matrix, followed by number of columns 
- `row_names` - Names for each row of the matrix (optional) 
- `col_names` - Names for each column of the matrix (optional) 
- `storage_order`- `col` for compressed-sparse-column, or `row` for compressed-sparse-row 

Bitpacked compressed matrices consist of the following modifications:

- `val`: For unsigned 32-bit integers, we replace `val` with `val_data`,
  `val_idx`, and `val_idx_offsets` corresponding to a BP-128m1 encoding as
  described below. The total number of values is already stored as the last
  value in `idxptr`. For 32-bit and 64-bit floats `val` remains unchanged.
- `index`: We replace the `index` array with a BP-128d1z encoded data in arrays
  `index_data`, `index_idx`, `index_idx_offsets`, and `index_starts`

Each matrix is stored as a single directory, HDF5 group, or R S4 object. The
storage format for each matrix is encoded as a version string. The current
version string is of the format `[compression]-[datatype]-matrix-v2`, where
`[compression]` can be either `packed` or `unpacked`, and `[datatype]` can be
one of `uint`, `float`, or `double` corresponding to 32-bit unsigned integer,
32-bit float, and 64-bit double respectively. In v1 formats, the only difference
is that `idxptr` had type uint32.

## Genomic fragments logical storage layout

BPCells fragment files store (chromosome, start, end, cell ID) for each fragment, sorted by (chromosome, start). 
The coordinate system follows the bed format convention, where the first base of a chromosome is numbered 0 and the end coordinate of each fragment is non-inclusive. 
This means a 10 base pair long fragment starting at the first base of the genome will have start=0 and end=10. 
End coordinates are always guaranteed to be at least as large as start coordinates.

Uncompressed fragment data is stored in the following arrays:

| Name         | Type   | Length                           |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `cell`       | uint32 | # fragments                      |
| `start`      | uint32 | # fragments                      |
| `end`        | uint32 | # fragments                      |
| `end_max`    | uint32 | $\lceil$# fragments/128$\rceil$|
| `chr_ptr`    | uint64 | 2 $\times$ # chromosomes          |
| `cell_names` | string | # cells                          |
| `chr_names`  | string | # chromosomes                    |


These arrays have the following contents:

- `cell`: List of numeric cell IDs, one per fragment. The smallest cell ID is 0.  
- `start`: List of fragment start coordinates. The first base in a chromosome is 0.
- `end`: List of fragment end coordinates. The base of the end coordinate is one past the last base in the fragment.  
- `end_max`: `end_max[i]` is the maximum end coordinate of all fragments from the start of the chromosome to the fragment at index `i*128-127`. 
  If multiple chromosomes have fragments in a given chunk of 128 fragments, `end_max` is the maximum of all those end coordinates. 
  The `end_max` array allows for quickly seeking to fragments overlapping a given genomic region.  
- `chr_ptr`: `chr_ptr[2*i]` is the index of the first fragment in chromosome `i` in the `cell`, `start`, and `end` arrays. 
  `chr_ptr[2*i + 1]-1` is the index of the last fragment in chromosome `i`. 
  Fragments need not necessarily be sorted in order of increasing chromosome ID, though all fragments for a given chromosome must still be stored contiguously. 
  This allows logically re-ordering chromosomes at write-time even if the input data source does not support reading chromosomes out-of-order (i.e. 10x fragment files without a genome index).  
- `cell_names`: string identifiers for each numeric cell ID.
- `chr_names`: string identifiers for each numeric chromosome ID.

Compressed fragments are stored with the following modifications: 

- `cell` is replaced with `cell_data`, `cell_idx`, and `cell_idx_offsets`, compressed according to BP-128 encoding.
- `start` is replaced with `start_data`, `start_idx`, `start_idx_offsets`, and `start_starts`, compressed according to BP-128d1 encoding.
- `end` is replaced with `end_data`, `end_idx`, and `end_idx_offsets`, which stores `start - end` for each fragment, encoded using BP-128 encoding.

The current version string is equal to `unpacked-fragments-v2` for uncompressed fragments, and `packed-fragments-v2` for compressed fragments. 
In v1 formats, the only difference is that `chr_ptr` had type uint32.

## Bitpacking formats

Our bitpacked formats are based on the formats described in a paper by
[Lemire and Boytsov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2137).

#### BP-128

The vanilla BP-128 format is stored in 3 arrays as follows:

- `data` - stream of bitpacked data, represented as 32-bit integers with the
  interleaved bit layout as shown in Lemire and Boytsov figure 6. A chunk of 128
  32-bit input integers with $B$ bits per integer will be stored using $4B$
  32-bit integers holding the bitpacked data.
- `idx` - list of 32-bit integers, where the encoded data for integers index
  `128*i` to `128*i + 127` can be found in data from index `idx[i]` to index
  `idx[i+1]-1`. For lists with $2^{32}$ (4 billion) entries or greater, idx
  stores the index modulo $2^{32}$
- `idx_offsets` - list of 64-bit integers, where the values of `idx` with
  indices from `idx_offsets[i]` to `idx_offsets[i+1]-1` should have `i*(2^32)`
  added to them.

#### BP-128m1

This is the same as BP-128, but with 1 subtracted from each value prior to compression

#### BP-128d1

Equivalent to the BP-128* algorithm from Lemire and Boytsov where integers are
difference encoded prior to bitpacking. This is best for lists of sorted
integers.

-  `data` - Encoding as with vanilla BP-128, but we do difference encoding prior
   to bitpacking: $x_{0}^{\prime}=0$, $x_{1}^{\prime}=x_{1}-x_{0}$,
   $x_{2}^{\prime}=x_{2}-x_{1}$, ..., $x_{127}^{\prime}=x_{127}-x_{126}$
- `idx`, `idx_offsets` - identical to BP-128
- `starts` - list of 32-bit integers, where `starts[i]` is the decoded value for the integer at index `128*i`

#### BP-128d1z

Similar to BP128d1 but with zigzag encoding applied after difference encoding.
This is best for lists of close but not fully sorted runs of integers.

- `data` - Encoding as with BP-128d1, but between difference encoding and
  bitpacking, the results are zigzag encoded, where $zigzag(x)=2x$ if $x\geq0$,
  and $zigzag(x)=-2x-1$ if $x<0$.
- `idx`, `idx_offsets` - identical to BP-128
- `starts` - identical to BP128-d1

Illustrative reference code for BP-128 and the d1 and zigzag transformations can be found 
[here](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/BPCells_paper/blob/main/utils/bitpacking-reference-implementation.cpp).

## Physical storage layout

The abstraction of named data arrays can be realized by a few different formats.
The three currently supported by BPCells are:

#### Directory of files format:

This is the default storage backend due to its simplicity and high performance. 
Arrays are stored as binary files within a directory. 
Numeric array files have an 8-byte header followed by data values in little-endian binary format for integers 
and IEEE-754 for 32-bit and 64-bit floating point numbers. Header values are 8-byte ASCII text 
as follows: unsigned 32-bit integer `UINT32v1`, unsigned 64-bit integer
`UINT64v1`, 32-bit float `FLOATSv1`, 64-bit float `DOUBLEv1`. Arrays of strings
are stored as ASCII text with one array value per line with no header. The
version string is stored as a file named "version" containing the version string
followed by a newline.

#### Hdf5 file format:

This storage backend can be useful for embedding BPCells formats as a group within an h5ad or other HDF5 file. 
Arrays of numbers are stored as HDF5 datasets using the built-in HDF5 encoding
format. Arrays of strings are stored as HDF5 variable length string datasets.

The version string is stored as a version attribute on the HDF5 group.

#### R object format:

This storage backend is primarily useful for testing, or when bitpacking compression of in-memory data is desired to avoid disk bandwidth bottlenecks. 
Strings are stored as native R character arrays. Unsigned integers and 32-bit
floats are stored in native R integer arrays by bitcasting the R signed integers
into the required data types. 64-bit floats are stored in native R numeric
arrays. 64-bit integers are stored as doubles in R numeric arrays. This reduces
the highest representable value from $2^{64}-1$ to $2^{53}-1$ (about 9
quadrillion), which we do not expect to pose practical problems. Named
collections of arrays are stored in R lists (when writing) or S4 objects (when
reading). The version string is stored as a string vector named "version" of
length 1.
