\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the hdf5 file on disk}

\item{feature_type}{Optional selection of feature types to include in output matrix.
For multiome data, the options are "Gene Expression" and "Peaks". This option is
only compatible with files from cellranger 3.0 and newer.}

\item{buffer_size}{For performance tuning only. The number of items to be buffered
in memory before calling writes to disk.}

\item{mat}{IterableMatrix}

\item{barcodes}{Vector of names for the cells}

\item{feature_ids}{Vector of IDs for the features}

\item{feature_names}{Vector of names for the features}

\item{feature_types}{String or vector of feature types}

\item{feature_metadata}{Named list of additional metadata vectors
to store for each feature}

\item{chunk_size}{For performance tuning only. The chunk size used for the HDF5 array storage.}

\description{
Read/write a 10x feature matrix
}
\details{
The 10x format makes use of gzip compression for the matrix data,
which can slow down read performance. Consider writing into another format
if the read performance is important to you.

Input matrices must be in column-major storage order,
and if the rownames and colnames are not set, names must be
provided for the relevant metadata parameters. Some of the
metadata parameters are not read by default in BPCells, but
it is possible to export them for use with other tools.
