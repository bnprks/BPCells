This provides an overview of the BPCells compressed and uncompressed matrix
formats as they stand as of April 2023. While BPCells is pre-1.0 these formats
may be updated, though with a goal of maintaining backwards read-compatibility
across updates.

### Matrix Logical Storage Layout

For data storage, we use a storage abstraction of named data arrays, stored as
e.g. a single group hdf5 or a directory of files. The matrix format is a
compressed sparse column/row (CSC/CSR) format with the following data arrays:

| Name            | Type                   | Length      |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `val`           | uint32/float32/float64 | # non-zeros |
| `index`         | uint32                 | # non-zeros |
| `idxptr`        | uint64                 | # cols + 1  |
| `shape`         | uint32                 | 2           |
| `row_names`     | string                 | 0 or #rows  |
| `col_names`     | string                 | 0 or #cols  |
| `storage_order` | string                 | 1           |

The interpretation of each array is as follows:

- `val` - Values of non-zero entries in increasing order of (column, row)
  position of the non-zero value.
- `index` - `index[i]` provides the 0-based row index for the value found in
  `val[i]` (or column index for row-major storage order)
- `idxptr` - The indexes in `idx` and `val` for the entries in column `j` can be
  found from `idxptr[j]` to `idxptr[j+1] - 1` , inclusive. (or row j for
  row-major storage order)
- `shape` - number of rows in matrix, followed by number of columns 
- `row_names` - Names for each row of the matrix (optional) 
- `col_names` - Names for each column of the matrix (optional) 
- `storage_order`- `col` for compressed-sparse-column, or `row` for compressed-sparse-row 

Bitpacked compressed matrices consist of the following modifications:

- `val`: For unsigned 32-bit integers, we replace `val` with `val_data`,
  `val_idx`, and `val_idx_offsets` corresponding to a BP-128m1 encoding as
  described below. The total number of values is already stored as the last
  value in `idxptr`. For 32-bit and 64-bit floats `val` remains unchanged.
- `index`: We replace the `index` array with a BP-128d1z encoded data in arrays
  `index_data`, `index_idx`, `index_idx_offsets`, and `index_starts`

Each matrix is stored as a single directory, HDF5 group, or R S4 object. The
storage format for each matrix is encoded as a version string. The current
version string is of the format `[compression]-[datatype]-matrix-v2`, where
`[compression]` can be either `packed` or `unpacked`, and `[datatype]` can be
one of `uint`, `float`, and `double` corresponding to 32-bit unsigned integer,
32-bit float, and 64-bit double respectively. In v1 formats, the only difference
is that `idxptr` had type uint32.

## Bitpacking formats

Our bitpacked formats are based on the formats described in a paper by
[Lemire and Boytsov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2137).

#### BP-128

The vanilla BP-128 format is stored in 3 arrays as follows:

- `data` - stream of bitpacked data, represented as 32-bit integers with the
  interleaved bit layout as shown in Lemire and Boytsov figure 6. A chunk of 128
  32-bit input integers with $B$ bits per integer will be stored using $4B$
  32-bit integers holding the bitpacked data.
- `idx` - list of 32-bit integers, where the encoded data for integers index
  `128*i` to `128*i + 127` can be found in data from index `idx[i]` to index
  `idx[i+1]-1`. For lists with $2^{32}$ (4 billion) entries or greater, idx
  stores the index modulo $2^{32}$
- `idx_offsets` - list of 64-bit integers, where the values of `idx` with
  indices from `idx_offsets[i]` to `idx_offsets[i+1]-1` should have `i*(2^32)`
  added to them.

#### BP-128m1

This is the same as BP-128, but with 1 subtracted from each value prior to compression

#### BP-128d1

Equivalent to the BP-128* algorithm from Lemire and Boytsov where integers are
difference encoded prior to bitpacking. This is best for lists of sorted
integers.

-  `data` - Encoding as with vanilla BP-128, but we do difference encoding prior
   to bitpacking: $x_{0}^{\prime}=0$, $x_{1}^{\prime}=x_{1}-x_{0}$,
   $x_{2}^{\prime}=x_{2}-x_{1}$, ..., $x_{127}^{\prime}=x_{127}-x_{126}$
- `idx`, `idx_offsets` - identical to BP-128
- `starts` - list of 32-bit integers, where `starts[i]` is the decoded value for the integer at index `128*i`

#### BP-128d1z

Similar to BP128d1 but with zigzag encoding applied after difference encoding.
This is best for lists of close but not fully sorted runs of integers.

- `data` - Encoding as with BP-128d1, but between difference encoding and
  bitpacking, the results are zigzag encoded, where $zigzag(x)=2x$ if $x\geq0$,
  and $zigzag(x)=-2x-1$ if $x<0$.
- `idx`, `idx_offsets` - identical to BP-128
- `starts` - identical to BP128-d1

 The core bitpacking code can be found in [`src/bitpacking/bp128.cpp`](https://github.com/bnprks/BPCells/blob/main/src/bitpacking/bp128.cpp) in the github repository.



## Physical storage layout

The abstraction of named data arrays can be realized by a few different formats.
The three currently supported by BPCells are:

#### Directory of files format:

An array of numbers is stored as a single file with an 8-byte header, followed
by the data values in little-endian binary format. Unsigned integers are encoded
according to standard little-endian representation, and 32-bit and 64-bit
floating point numbers as IEEE-754 format. Header values are 8-byte ASCII text
as follows: unsigned 32-bit integer `UINT32v1`, unsigned 64-bit integer
`UINT64v1`, 32-bit float `FLOATSv1`, 64-bit float `DOUBLEv1`. Arrays of strings
are stored as ASCII text with one array value per line with no header. The
version string is stored as a file named version containing the version string
followed by a newline.

#### Hdf5 file format:

Arrays of numbers are stored as HDF5 datasets using the built-in HDF5 encoding
format. Arrays of strings are stored as HDF5 variable length string datasets.

The version string is stored as a version attribute on the HDF5 group

#### R object format:

Strings are stored as native R character arrays. Unsigned integers and 32-bit
floats are stored in native R integer arrays by bitcasting the R signed integers
into the required data types. 64-bit floats are stored in native R numeric
arrays. 64-bit integers are stored as doubles in R numeric arrays. This reduces
the highest representable value from $2^{64}-1$ to $2^{53}-1$ (about 9
quadrillion), which we do not expect to pose practical problems. Named
collections of arrays are stored in R lists (when writing) or S4 objects (when
reading). The version string is stored as a string vector named version of
length 1.
